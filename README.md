# exponential-notes

The aim was to build this single page app notes using self rendering components, similar to React. 
However we were restricted using vanilla javascript without any third party framework which meant we had to create our own test suite in order to test drive the development.

To guide the team on how to write these components this example [repo](https://github.com/toddpla/component-example) was created.
